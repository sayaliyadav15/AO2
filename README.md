=> Introduction to WebStorm :
- WebStorm is an Intergrated Development Environment (IDE) developed ed by JetBrains. It is well known for its JavaScript, HTML, CSS and related technologies which helps enhance the web development and other programming experiences.
- Few other advantages of using WebStorm as an IDE is that it has powerful web development tools, version control integration, built-in debugging tools, compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux, ability to share your project and work in a group, and availability of multiple language support.
- The core topic used as a reference, for the purposes of this tutorial will be elements used for web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

=> Setting up WebStorm :
1.Download WebStorm from their official website : WebStorm
If you are a student, then you can apply for the free student developer pack after completing the necessary procedures for the same.
2. Click the download button.
3. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Follow the on-screen instructions to install WebStorm.
You may be prompted to create or log in with a JetBrains account during the installation process.
4. Now you can launch WebStorm on your device.

=> The Interface :
1.On the Welcome screen, you can:
Create a new project.
Open an existing project.
Check for updates.
Access pre-built tutorials.
2. The WebStorm IDE interface includes panels for coding, project files, and tools.
3. Create a New Project:
Click "Create New Project" to create a new web development project.
Select the project type (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
Choose the project location and set project-specific settings and click "Create."
4. It is always preferred to enable version control every time you code and commit the pages whenever appropriate. 
To do this you need : open the tools panel or search for version control click on version control < choose either Git or GitHub.

=>Introduction to Git and GitHub :
1. Both Git and GitHub are types of version control systems. They help with tracking of changes to files and easier collaboration among multiple users, when you commit your files to either of them.
2. More information about Git can be found on : [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](url)
3. More information about GitHub can be found on : [https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/](url)
4. The main difference between the both is the fact that GitHub can help you publish your website on the internet as it has options like creating live servers, but Git only helps you save changes and version of your code. However, since GitHub uses Git repositories you cannot use GitHub without Git.

=> Setting up Git and GitHub :
1. 1.Git :
Go to Git's official website and click download according to your respective operating system by following the instructions for each one of them : [https://git-scm.com/downloads](url)
2.GitHub :
Got to their official website and create an account on: [https://github.com/](url)

=> Using Git and GitHub :
1. Now once you have a code you would want to save those files by committing them to a Git repository. You can do this by :
- Opening the tools panel or search for version control.
- Click on version control < choose Git.
- Choose the file(s) to commit and add a commit comment. If this is your first commit ever, you will have a dialog box open.
- Set the Git username and email (Click Set and Commit).
- Create a name and location for your repository.
- It should successfully commit your files.
2.Now, for adding your project to GitHub :
- Opening the tools panel or search for version control.
- Click on version control < choose GitHub < click on share project on GitHub.
- Enter the name of the repository and the GitHub account to share by< click share.
- If successful it prompts the message for the same.
3.You can now continue editing your code in WebStorm and keep committing to Git to save your changes.
4.For saving the changes to GitHub, you need to select the file  and 'Push' (your second commit) to GitHub. It can also prompt you to merge your GitHub to your local machine so that these changes are saved automatically

=> Glossary Terms :
1. **Branch**: In Git, a branch is a separate development line that allows you to work on a specific feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.
2. **Clone**: In Git, cloning a repository implies making a copy of it on your local workstation so you can work on the code from any place.
3. **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to a repository at a certain moment in time in Git. It is a method of saving and recording changes with a descriptive message.
4. **Fetch**: In Git, fetching implies retrieving changes from a remote repository and updating your local copy without instantly merging 5. them into your current branch.
6. **GIT**: Git is a distributed version control system that is used to track changes in source code when developing software. It is well-known for its code management flexibility and efficiency.
7. **GitHub**: GitHub is a web-based platform that houses Git repositories. It includes tools for collaboration as well as functionality for code review, bug tracking, and project management.
8. **Merge**: merging is the process of mixing changes from one branch into another, usually from a feature branch into the main branch.
9. **Merge Conflict**: when there are conflicting changes between branches that cannot be merged automatically. To resolve these issues, manual action is required.
10. **Push** : pushing implies uploading your local changes to a remote repository, making them available to others, and updating the remote repository with your work.
11. **Pull** : pulling implies retrieving changes from a remote repository and applying those changes to your local branch. It is frequently used to keep your local copy current with the most recent modifications from a remote repository.
12. **Remote** : A remote in Git is a reference to a repository stored on a remote server, most commonly on sites like GitHub. It enables you to interface with and synchronize changes across your local and remote repositories.
13. **Repository**: A repository in Git is a storage area that contains all the project files, history, and configuration. It might be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).
